Prime digit replacements

By replacing the 1st digit of *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible
values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.

By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit
number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers,
yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently
56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent
 digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.
