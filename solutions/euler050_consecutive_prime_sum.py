Consecutive Prime Sum

The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below
one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a
prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most
consecutive primes?
