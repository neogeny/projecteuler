You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research
for yourself.

    1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
    Thirty days has September,
    April, June and November.
    All the rest have thirty-one,
    Saving February alone,
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
    A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century
    unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century
(1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
